// Declare a class Steak that extends class Meat
// Declare an enum Doneness with the following values:
// - Raw, Rare, Medium, Well Done, Charred

// Steak should have a property doneness that is readable by everyone,
// but can only be written to by instances of Steak. Steaks start out raw.

// Define a method cook() that increases the Doneness level by 1,
// until it's Charred

// Create a main function that "cooks" a steak 10 times and prints out the
// doneness after each "cook".
