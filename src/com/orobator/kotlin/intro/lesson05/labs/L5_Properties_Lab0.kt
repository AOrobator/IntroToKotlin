// Create a class called Pool. Pool should take a maxFill: Int in the
// constructor as a read only property. By default, it should be 50,000.
// Also create a read/write property called gallons that only takes 0 and
// positive integers up to maxFill. By default, gallons should be half of
// maxFill.

// Give Pool a property called waterLevel: Int. Assume that the
// water level rises by 1ft every 5,000 gallons.

// Create an alternate version of Pool called Pool2 that has the same
// restrictions as above, but can take gallons as a constructor param
