// Create a class called Pool. Pool should take a maxFill: Int in the
// constructor as a read only property. Also create a read/write property
// called gallons that only takes 0 and positive integers up to maxFill.
// By default, gallons should be half of maxFill.

// Give Pool a property called waterLevel: Int. Assume that the
// water level rises by 1ft every 20 gallons.
