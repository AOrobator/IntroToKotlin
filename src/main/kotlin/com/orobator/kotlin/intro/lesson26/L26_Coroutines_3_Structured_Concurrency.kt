/**
 * After launching a coroutine, you may want to wait for it to complete before
 * continuing program execution. If you were using threads, you could use
 * [Thread.join] in order to wait for a particular thread to die. You can do
 * something similar with coroutines and [Job]s.

fun jobJoinDemo() = runBlocking {
    val job: Job = GlobalScope.launch { // launch a new coroutine and keep a reference to its Job
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,")
    job.join() // wait until child coroutine completes
}

// Notice that the launch function returns a Job. You can think of a Job as
// being the handle to your coroutine's ongoing work. With a reference to your
// coroutine's job, you can either wait for it to finish with the join method,
// or you can cancel the job to stop the execution of your coroutine.

// Structured concurrency

// There is still something to be desired for practical usage of coroutines.
// When we use GlobalScope.launch, we create a top-level coroutine. Even though
// it is light-weight, it still consumes some memory resources while it runs. If
// we forget to keep a reference to the newly launched coroutine, it still runs.
// What if the code in the coroutine hangs (for example, we erroneously delay
// for too long), what if we launched too many coroutines and ran out of memory?
// Having to manually keep references to all the launched coroutines and join
// them is error-prone.
//
// There is a better solution. We can use structured concurrency in our code.
// Instead of launching coroutines in the GlobalScope, just like we usually do
// with threads (threads are always global), we can launch coroutines in the
// specific scope of the operation we are performing.
//
// In our example, we have a main function that is turned into a coroutine using
// the runBlocking coroutine builder. Every coroutine builder, including
// runBlocking, adds an instance of CoroutineScope to the scope of its code
// block. We can launch coroutines in this scope without having to join them
// explicitly, because an outer coroutine (runBlocking in our example) does not
// complete until all the coroutines launched in its scope complete. Thus, we
// can make our example simpler:

fun structuredConcurrencyDemo() = runBlocking { // this: CoroutineScope
    launch { // launch a new coroutine in the scope of runBlocking
        delay(1000L)
        println("World!")
    }
    println("Hello,")
}

// A coroutine is always launched within a CoroutineScope. Coroutine builders
// like launch and runBlocking give our coroutines a scope to run in.

// Structured concurrency is very useful because we don't have to call Job.join
// all the time, but it also helps us out with cancellation.

// Let's pretend that we're writing a ViewModel that is responsible for the
// business logic of a particular screen. In this example, we'll write
// StockTickerViewModel which makes a network call to refresh the stock tickers
// on screen every 5 seconds. We'll also be updating the price of Bitcoin every
// 10 seconds. -> ELABORATE w/ ViewModelScope, lifecycle example

class StockTickerViewModel {
    // First we'll create our own CoroutineScope that we'll use to launch all of
    // our coroutines in. The ViewModel provided in the Android Jetpack
    // libraries provides us with a viewModelScope with a similar
    // implementation.
    private val viewModelScope: CoroutineScope = MainScope() // ðŸ‘ˆ CMD+B to go to definition of MainScope

    // When we go to the definition of MainScope, it looks like it's made out of
    // 3 components: ContextScope, SupervisorJob, and Dispatchers.Main. Let's
    // focus on SupervisorJob for now. Children of a supervisor job can fail
    // independently of each other. A failure or cancellation of a child does
    // not cause the supervisor job to fail and does not affect its other
    // children.

    var hasInitialized = false

    fun init() {
        if (hasInitialized) return

        // Because children can fail independently, EXPLAIN ONE WON"T CRASH THE OTHER
        viewModelScope.launch {
            while (true) {
                delay(5_000L)
                // Fetch stocks
                // TODO it'd be dope if you actually fetch real data and had a working view model
            }
        }

        viewModelScope.launch {
            while (true) {
                delay(10_000L)
                // Fetch BTC
            }
        }



        hasInitialized = true
    }
}


 // - Close scope of viewModel, in between it launches a bunch of coroutines

val foo = Thread().join()
// Compare to thread.join(), tracking all launched threads and having to manage them

// Instead use scopes. coroutine builders (examples) give your coroutines a scope to run in

// lambda with receiver type as parameter to coroutine builder

// mention GlobalScope

// show code with running coroutine getting cancelled? throw in some scopes?

///////////////
// Benefits

// The scope is generally responsible for child coroutines, and their lifetime
// is attached to the lifetime of the scope.

// The scope can automatically cancel child coroutines if something goes wrong
// or if a user simply changes their mind and decides to revoke the operation.

// The scope automatically waits for completion of all the child coroutines.
// Therefore, if the scope corresponds to a coroutine, then the parent coroutine
// does not complete until all the coroutines launched in its scope are complete.


// Compare cancellation of GlobalScope with cancellation of other scopes

//////////
// Jobs

// coroutine builders usually return jobs (runBlocking is an exception)
// job.join()

// Cancellation,
// lab exploring cancellation
// Scoping (SupervisorScope)
